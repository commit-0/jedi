"""
This caching is very important for speed and memory optimizations. There's
nothing really spectacular, just some decorators. The following cache types are
available:

- ``time_cache`` can be used to cache something for just a limited time span,
  which can be useful if there's user interaction and the user cannot react
  faster than a certain time.

This module is one of the reasons why |jedi| is not thread-safe. As you can see
there are global variables, which are holding the cache information. Some of
these variables are being cleaned after every API usage.
