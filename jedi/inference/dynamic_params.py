"""
One of the really important features of |jedi| is to have an option to
understand code like this::

    def foo(bar):
        bar. # completion here
    foo(1)

There's no doubt wheter bar is an ``int`` or not, but if there's also a call
like ``foo('str')``, what would happen? Well, we'll just show both. Because
that's what a human would expect.

It works as follows:

- |Jedi| sees a param
- search for function calls named ``foo``
- execute these calls and check the input.
